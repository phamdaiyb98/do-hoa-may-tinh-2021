# OpenGL Circuit Race Project
This project is a simple race game in which you can control a car and drive it around a circuit. This game was developped as part of the IG (Informatique Graphique) class taught in the 1st year of Master's degree in Computer Science at the Université de Franche-Comté.

### Build
This project is made to run on Windows 7 or above using Visual Studio. Open `Projet.sln` with Visual Studio and run it from there using the debugging tool. The only requirement is for `glut32.dll` to be placed in `C:\Windows\System32` or in the `Bin` folder of this project.
